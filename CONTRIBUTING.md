## Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Active Admin. It's people
like you that make Active Admin such a great tool.

### Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one][new issue]! It's
generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature
request this way before starting to code.

If you have a general question about activeadmin, you can post it on [Stack
Overflow], the issue tracker is only for bugs and feature requests.

### Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork Active Admin] and create
a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-translations
```


### Get the style right

Your patch should follow the same conventions & pass the same code quality
checks as the rest of the project. `bin/rake lint` will give you feedback in
this regard. You can check & fix style issues by running each linter
individually. Run `bin/rake -T lint` to see the available linters.

### Make a Pull Request

At this point, you should switch back to your master branch and make sure it's
up to date with Active Admin's master branch:

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:activeadmin/activeadmin.git
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

Then update your feature branch from your local copy of master, and push it!

```sh
git checkout 325-add-japanese-translations
git rebase master
git push --set-upstream origin 325-add-japanese-translations
```

Finally, go to GitHub and [make a Pull Request][] :D

Github Actions will run our test suite against all supported Rails versions. We
care about quality, so your PR won't be merged until all tests pass. It's
unlikely, but it's possible that your changes pass tests in one Rails version
but fail in another. In that case, you'll have to setup your development
environment (as explained in step 3) to use the problematic Rails version, and
investigate what's going on!

### Keeping your Pull Request updated

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code
has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

To learn more about rebasing in Git, there are a lot of [good][git rebasing]
[resources][interactive rebase] but here's the suggested workflow:

```sh
git checkout 325-add-japanese-translations
git pull --rebase upstream master
git push --force-with-lease 325-add-japanese-translations
```
